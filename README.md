# Financial-Analysis-Dashboard

Description:

I undertook the development of a comprehensive financial dashboard using MS Excel to visually represent an arbitrary company's earnings based on an existing financial model. The goal was to provide a clear and insightful overview of the company's financial performance, focusing on key metrics and trends.

<b>Key Features</b>:
- Waterfall Chart for Net Earnings (2022):
  Implemented a waterfall chart to showcase the breakdown of net earnings for the year 2022.
  Distinguished hard-coded figures in blue and formula-generated figures in black for easy identification.
  Categories included total earnings, deductions, and final net earnings, providing a concise yet detailed representation.
  
- Cash Flow and Balance Visualization (2018-2022):
  Utilized a combo chart to illustrate the company's cash flow over the period from 2018 to 2022.
  The line graph depicted the cash balance evolution across the years, offering a dynamic view of the company's liquidity.

-Productivity Rate Comparison Across Businesses:
  Implemented horizontally clustered bar charts to compare productivity rates across three distinct business segments.
  Clearly visualized and highlighted Business 2 as the most productive in 2022, fostering quick insights into comparative performance.
  
<b>Key Insights</b>:
- Total Earnings in 2022:
  Through the dashboard, it was revealed that the company's total earnings after deductions amounted to an impressive Â£74,000 in the year 2022.
- Cash Balance Peaks in 2021:
  The visualization showcased a peak in the cash balance during 2021, providing a notable point for further analysis and consideration.
- Business 2 Dominates Productivity in 2022:
  The productivity rate analysis indicated that Business 2 outperformed other segments in 2022, suggesting areas for potential expansion or optimization.
  
<b>Techniques Employed</b>:
- Waterfall Chart Design:
  Applied advanced Excel features to create an engaging waterfall chart, emphasizing transparency in earnings breakdown.
  
- Combo Chart for Cash Flow:
  Leveraged Excel's combo chart capabilities to seamlessly integrate line and bar graphs for a holistic view of cash flow.

- Horizontally Clustered Bar Charts:
  Implemented horizontally clustered bar charts for productivity rate comparison, ensuring a visually intuitive representation of performance across business segments.

Outcome:
This is part of my ongoing BIDA certification and the financial dashboard successfully distilled complex financial data into easily digestible visualizations, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on key insights. The project showcases proficiency in data visualization, Excel functionality, and a basic understanding of financial metrics and models.
